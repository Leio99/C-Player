# C-Player
A simple Music Player made with WPF and C#.

# How it works
You just need to add your songs to the songs folder, which is in this directory: bin/debug/songs

Warning: make sure your songs have the .WAV extension, or they won't appear in the songlist.

# How to start the program
Just open the Player.exe file which is in this directory: bin/debug/ and choose your song.
